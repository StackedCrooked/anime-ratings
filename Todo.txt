Brain storming
--------------
- Introduce a server
    . Can store all mappings.
    . Can store user's viewed animes.
- Add a "Add" button to add to MAL.
- Maintain a pure mapping between wikipedia and mal urls. The current system of improving search terms and improving results is way too messy.
- Allow user to fix wrong Wikipedia-MAL mappings.
