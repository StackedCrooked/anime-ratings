- Maintain a pure mapping between wikipedia and mal urls. The current system of improving search terms and improving results is way too messy.
- Add a "Add" button to add to MAL.
- Visibility treshold should also hide the original link.
- Improve Google Analytics. Track usage of all features.
- Introduce a server
    . Can store all mappings.
    . Can store user's viewed animes.
- Use [+] and [-] to expand and collapse the ratings that go with a title.
- Scrape Anime News Network rating
    . URL is usually found in the Wikipedia title page external links section
    . Highlight if median rating is "Very good" or better
- Support other lists:
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Action_anime_and_manga
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magical_girl_anime_and_manga
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fantasy_anime_and_manga
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Supernatural_anime_and_manga
- Idea: Allow user to fix wrong Wikipedia-MAL mappings:
    - This requires online storage of some form... (VPS)
    - Add a "(edit)" link next to the title.
    - If the user clicks it then
        - show a combobox containing alternatives
        - show a textbox to search MAL
        - allow the user to paste the correct MAL url in the the textbox
